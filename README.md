# ft_ls

This project is an implementation of UNIX command ls in C language.

Objectives:

* Understanding the tree of files and directories
* Managing types and characteristics of files

In addition to the display, i managed the flags "-GRUalrtu":
for usage, just clone the repo, "make" it, and then:

usage: ./ft_ls [-GRUalrtu] [file ...]

any optimization or advice is welcomed!!!!
